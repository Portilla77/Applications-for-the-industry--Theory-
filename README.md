## Applications for the Industry: Theoretical Foundations
This repository is dedicated to the documentation and explanation of mathematical models used in industrial applications. Its purpose is to display solutions through equations and theoretical frameworks that serve as the foundation for code development.

It should be taken into account that the source code implementing these models is contained within a private repository. However, pseudocode will be provided to offer an introduction to the content. If you wish to access the repository to see the practical implementation of these models, you may request it by sending an email to athan.phi@outlook.com.
